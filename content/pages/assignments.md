Partial Differential Equation Assignment 1
------------------------------------------

Assignment 1 as a ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/pset-1))

### Problem 1

Prove that a Harmonic function with an interior maximum is constant.

### Problem 2

Write out the laplacian in planepolar coordinates.

### Problem 3

A Green's function on ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg)n is a harmonic function on ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg)n \\{0} which depends only on the radius (for example log r on ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg)2). Find nontrivial Green's functions for all dimensions.

### Problem 4

The heat equation for a function u: ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg) × \[0, ∞) is ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/eq1.jpg). Find all solutions of the form u = ƒ(t)g(x).

### Problem 5

Find all solutions u of the heat equation on \[0, 1\] × \[0, ∞) with the u = 0 on ({0} ∪ {1}) × \[0, ∞).

Assignment 2 as a ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/pset2-1))

### Problem 1

Let u be a function on the ball B1(0) ⊂ ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg)2 with ∫B1(0) |![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/eq2.jpg)u|p <\]infty for some constant p > 2. Show that u is holder continuous. \[Hint: Use Morrey on ∫ 1.|![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/eq2.jpg)u|2 \]

### Problem 2

Let u: ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg)n → ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg), and define OSCBr(x)u = supBr(x)u - infBr(x)u. Show that if there is some constant 0 < γ < 1 with

oscBr(x)u ≤ γ oscB2r(x)u

for all x and all r then u is Holder continuous.

### Problem 3

Let L be a uniformly elliptic 2nd order operator in divergence form taking

![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/eq3.jpg)

Let u be a function with Lu ≥ 0, and Φ: ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg) → ![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/R1.jpg) a function with Φ', Φ" ≥ 0. Show that L(Φ(u))≥ 0.

### Problem 4

Let L be an operator as in question 3, and let u be an L harmonic function. Prove that |![](/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2005/assignments/eq2.jpg)u|2 is holder contiuous. \[This is likely to be difficult.\]
